  <h2>I get paid to write code?!</h2>
<p>Last week was my first week working as a professional jr. software engineer and it was GREAT. I really like the people I work with, really enjoy working in Rails (I'm full-stack btw, Ruby just holds a special place in my heart ❤️), and I just love that I get to spend most of my days now thinking about code. I feel incredibly fortunate.</p>
<p>Now that I am working full-time in this role, though, I've been thinking about how I will continue to go about my days of learning and improving my programming skills outside of the 9-5. I'll dive in next to what I've come up with so far.</p>
<h2>General Learning Goals</h2>
<p>I'd like to improve in the following areas:</p>
<p><strong>Full-stack web development:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>General front-end, including CSS and React</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>General programming:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Object oriented programming (Reading POODR by Sandi Metz)?</li>
<li>General development methodologies / best practices (Reading The Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt and Davis Thomas)</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently, my plan is to continue creating side projects to understand how things get made. I don't want to focus on creating anything original because it would take me a really long time to think of something and start. Instead, I'd like to just focus on building things from scratch, learning new things, and recording the new things I learn in learning logs on this blog. I'm sharing what I'm learning on this blog <em>primarily</em> to have a log to look back on myself, but also because I think writing out what I'm learning on a public platform will encourage me to really understand what I'm learning. On that note...</p>
<h2>Learning Log #01</h2>
<p>So I started a new rails project that is essentially a photo-sharring app that enables a user to upload a picture with a caption. It uses <a href="https://cloudinary.com/">Cloudinary</a> for storing pictures and <a href="pusher.com">Pusher</a> to update the feed in real time. I'm hoping to integrate the <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a> gem for authentication, since my first rails app just used sessions and cookies. And I'm also hoping to create the front-end with <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails">react-rails</a>.</p>
<h3>Things I've learned this week</h3>
<h4>How to store credentials (like API keys/secrets) safely using environment variables.</h4>
<p>We can use the gem <a href="https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv">dotenv</a>, which loads environment variables from the <code>.env</code> file and creates an array <code>ENV</code> in development. You place your <code>.env</code> file in <code>.gitnignore</code>, which is a file that Git uses to determine which files/directories to ignore before you make a commit.</p>
<h4>What scaffolding is in Rails and when to use it.</h4>
<p>Scaffolding in Ruby on Rails refers to the auto-generation of a Model, Views, and Controller for a table (such as Users). For example, using the command `rails generate scaffold User&quot; would create a full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) web interface for the Users table. Basically, it's a quick way to autogenerate a lot of things you might need when creating a new data table in a project. It's not always necessary, though, because you may not need the full CRUD functionality. (PS, I'm not using scaffolding to create my photosharing project!)</p>
<p>Other things I've learned from work...</p>
<h4>What is HAML?</h4>
<p><a href="https://haml.info/about.html">HAML</a>, which stands for HTML Abstraction Markup Language, is a markup language that’s used to cleanly and simply describe the HTML of any web document without the use of inline code.</p>
<h4>What is coffeescript?</h4>
<p><a href="https://coffeescript.org/#introduction">Coffeescript</a> is a programming language that compiles to JavaScript. It adds syntactic sugar inspired by Ruby, Python and Haskell in an effort to enhance JavaScript's brevity and readability. (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoffeeScript">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
