  <p><em>This is the sixth post in my series on learning html game development. You can find the other posts <a href="./#related-posts">here</a>!</em></p>
<p>This post brings us to an end of my series on adding features to Adventures of Leat. The final features I will discuss include an animation effect I added to when Leat enters a door with a key, as well as a camera fade that occurs when transitioning to the win screen. As always, if you're interested in learning how I implemented these features, just keep reading!</p>
<h2>Subtle Animations to Improve Realism</h2>
<p>Outside the land where Leat lives, when you open a door you have to actually go through the door before you enter into a new space. In the game, I emanate this illusion of realism by adding an animation which turns the door black while Leat walks through.</p>
<p>The parts of the code that are relevant for implementing this functionality include the door sprite, which is loaded in the <code>PlayState</code> class as <code>this.door</code> , as well as the method which handles the event <code>PlayState._onHeroVsDoor</code>.</p>
<p>First, we want to add an animation to our door sprite. In <code>PlayState.create</code> we add:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">this.door.animations.add(&quot;open&quot;, [1, 2], 8);
</code></pre>
<p>The arguments provided in this line of code do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>open</code>: the unique name which we will use to reference the animation when we want to play it</li>
<li><code>[1,2]</code>: the frames we will play from the sprite sheet (pictured below)</li>
<li><code>8</code>: the rate in frames per second we will play the animation frames</li>
</ul>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MGkFN8t.png" alt="sprite sheet of door"></center>
<p>Next, we will modify the event handler <code>PlayState._onHeroVsDoor</code> to play the animation and add a time event which allows the entire animation to play before loading the next level by adding a delay.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">PlayState._onHeroVsDoor = function (hero, door) {
  this.door.animations.play(&quot;open&quot;);
  this.game.time.events.add(100, this._nextLevel, this);
};
</code></pre>
<p>That's it! Now, when Leat enters the door with a key, the open door animation will play and make it look like they are actually going through the door ðŸ˜ƒ</p>

<h2>Savoring Victory</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Savoring is the capacity to notice, appreciate and intensify the positive aspects of our lives.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before ending the game and displaying the win screen, I wanted to add a way to enable the player to intentionally savor the moment of completing the game. In order to create this, I added a camera effect which fades the screen black before it eventually fades back to normal on the Win Screen.</p>
<p>To add this, we make use of <code>game.camera</code> which is automatically created when we initiatialize our <code>game</code> object. The camera is the view into our world. I'll include a description from the Phaser documentation itself, as I think the description is pretty good.</p>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8qOG4aK.png" alt="screenshot of Phaser camera documentation"></center>
<p><a href="https://phaser.io/docs/2.6.2/Phaser.Camera.html">https://phaser.io/docs/2.6.2/Phaser.Camera.html</a></p>
<p>There are a few things we will need to add in order to implement the camera fade effect, so I will summarize them before jumping into the code. We will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new function <code>PlayState.fade</code> which will execute the camera fading</li>
<li>a new function <code>PlayState.transitionToWinState</code> which will handle the change in state to the win state</li>
<li>a modification to <code>PlayState.create</code> to handle the fade completion</li>
<li>a modification to <code>PlayState._nextLevel</code> to call our fade function if the player has completed all the levels</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a fade effect, we use the <code>fade</code> function and specify the color and duration of the fade in milliseconds.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">PlayState.fade = function () {
  this.game.camera.fade(0x000000, 2000);
};
</code></pre>
<p>We also want to set up a handler for what happens after the fade completes, which in this instance is to transition to the Win State. Within <code>Phaser.Camera</code> is an event handler method called <code>onFadeComplete</code> which we will use. In <code>Phaser.create</code>, we set this up with this line of code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">Phaser.create = function () {
     ...
     this.game.camera.onFadeComplete.add(this.transitionToWinState, this);
     ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>This means we also need to set up our event handler for transitioning to the Win State!</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">PlayState.transitionToWinState = function () {
  this.game.state.start(&quot;win&quot;, true, false, { coins: this.coinPickupCount });
};
</code></pre>
<p>Lastly, we need to set up the call to fade the camera when the player is on the final level. This is handled in <code>PlayState._nextLevel</code>, so we will modify the conditional to call <code>this.fade()</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">PlayState._nextLevel = function () {
  if (this.hero.dying) {
    this.game.state.restart(true, false, {
      level: this.level,
      bgMusicPlaying: this.bgMusicPlaying,
    });
  } else if (this.level + 1 == LEVEL_COUNT) {
    // last level, make camera fade before transitioning!
    this.fade();
    this.music.pause();
  } else {
    this.game.state.restart(true, false, {
      level: this.level + 1,
      bgMusicPlaying: this.bgMusicPlaying,
    });
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>And it looks like...</p>
