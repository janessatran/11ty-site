        <p>Hello, again! As per usual, it has been a while since I have posted... but I am back with some exciting news. I've finally finished my rails application!! üòÉüéâ I wanted to write about my journey and what I learned, so this blog post will be about just that! Hope you've all been well and thanks for following my journey!</p>
<h2>How I did it</h2>
<p>A little less than 2 months ago, I started going through Michael Hartl's <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">Rails Tutorial</a> to learn Ruby on Rails. My evening's after work were spent reading through the chapters and building the sample application along with the book. I went through about half of the book before I realized this method of learning probably wasn't best for me. I felt like the information wasn't sticking as much, because I was building something straight out of a tutorial rather than having to struggle to find how to do something in the way I might if I were to build something from scratch (with no code to copy from a book/tutorial). So, I started over. I thought about an application that I wanted to make (which was surprisingly hard to do for me). I re-read the sections of the tutorial which covered the fundamentals (how to generate MVCs, migrations, etc). And I googled the rest that I didn't know how to do.</p>
<h2>What I built</h2>
<p>Inspired by some friends, I built a rails application called TIL notes, which stands for <em>Today I Learned</em>. The application can be viewed here: <a href="https://tilnotes.herokuapp.com/">https://tilnotes.herokuapp.com/</a>.</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>As a user of the rails application, one has the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create, Edit, and Delete a cheatsheets</li>
<li>Make your cheatsheet public or private</li>
<li>Search cheatsheets by tag (only public cheatsheets are searchable)</li>
<li>Favorite/unfavorite a cheatsheet</li>
<li>Access a list of all your favorited cheatsheet</li>
<li>Edit profile/settings, reset password</li>
<li>View other users' profiles</li>
<li>Follow/unfollow other users</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h2>What I learned</h2>
<p>This being my first real rails application, I learned a ton!!! I'll attempt to list what I learned below, but I may be forgetting to include a thing or two...</p>
<h3>Rails Things</h3>
<ul>
<li>How to generate a model and controller</li>
<li>How to generate a database migration</li>
<li>How to reset, migrate, and seed the database to show fake data</li>
<li>How to create templates using embedded Ruby</li>
<li>How to create partials to use in views</li>
<li>How to use persistent cookies to maintain state and remember users</li>
<li>How to generate Action Mailer actions and views to send email</li>
<li>How to use a generated token to create a unique URL to activate users</li>
<li>How to identify users for password resets (hashed reset digest to identify valid reset requests)</li>
<li>How to create an association between models (<code>has_many</code> and <code>belongs_to</code> methods in the Models)</li>
<li>How to query for Active Record selections</li>
<li>How to use Ajax to asynchronously send requests to the server without leaving the page (used in the following users and favoriting cheatsheet actions)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Things</h3>
<ul>
<li>How to practice Test-Driven Development / Behavior Driven Development</li>
<li>Write tests first to help predict course of development and document what is planned to be achieved in terms of test coverage.</li>
<li>Run tests that fail.</li>
<li>Write code to get the tests to pass.</li>
<li>How to write requests specs with Rspec and the difference between request specs and controller specs</li>
<li>Request specs include full routing and are designed to drive behavior</li>
<li>using Git to organize the project, creating new branches for different features, creating PRs (thanks to my friends who reviewed them!!), etc</li>
<li>How to use FactoryBot to set up objects to test with</li>
<li>How to use SimpleCov to track files and their coverage</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>As much as I would like to continue working on this rails application, I know that my time is best spent moving on to the next thing. What that is, I'm not exactly sure yet. I may continue to go through the rest of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a> or I may sit down and study some Object Oriented Design Principles in Ruby... I suppose I will keep you posted once I figure it out.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! üíù</p>
