<p>Setting up a new development environment can be a time consuming thing, but it doesn't have to be! That's where dotfiles come in.</p>
<p><strong>Dotfiles</strong> are essentially files that are used to customize your system, and they are named as such because the configuration files often start with a dot (you know, like <code>.bash_profile</code>, <code>.zshrc</code>, etc).</p>
<p>I'm storing my <a href="https://github.com/janessatran/dotfiles">dotfiles here</a>. At the moment, I just copy or symlink them to existing config files, but you can get real fancy and create an installation script if you want.</p>
<p>A <strong>symlink</strong> is a symbolic link that creates a shortcut to another file. So let's say I installed this <code>dotfiles</code> repo on a new computer and wanted to link the config files to my current config files (usually in the home directory, <code>~</code>). I would do something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ln -sv &quot;~/.dotfiles/git/.gitconfig&quot; ~
ln -sv &quot;~/.dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc&quot; ~
</code></pre>
<p>Boom! dotfiles setup ðŸŒŸ</p>
